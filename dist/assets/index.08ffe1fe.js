	Furthering through perseverance.`,resume:`The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines 
stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the 
spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is 
without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its 
energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is 
therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this 
motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power 
of persisting in time, that is, duration.

  The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense 
in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men. 
In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action 
of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of 
the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power 
awakens and develops their higher nature.
	`,judgment:`According to the original meaning, the attributes (sublimity, potentiality of 
success, power to further, perseverance) are paired. When an individual 
draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal 
depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his 
happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what 
is right.

  The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of 
speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime" 
means literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in 
explaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings 
owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven." For this 
attribute inheres in the other three as well.

  The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that 
have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend 
form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and 
the process is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the 
rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."  Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to 
notable success: "Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he 
completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them 
at the right time, as though on sic dragons." The six steps are the six different 
positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon 
symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and 
giving actuality to the way of the universe (Tao), which, as a law running 
through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each 
step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer 
a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.

  The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity 
and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous 
actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms 
"furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords with the nature of a 
given being") and "persevering" (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of 
the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific 
nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus 
does it show itself to further through perseverance."  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace 
and security to the world through his activity in creating order: "He towers 
high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."  Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words 
"sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance," and parallels them with 
the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the 
fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the 
attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize 
expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute 
furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which 
each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and 
which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated 
with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can 
therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already 
broached in the commentary called W\xEAn Yen , later formed the bridge 
connecting the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid 
down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of 
Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative 
principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of 
thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.
	`,image:{oracle:`The movement of heaven is full of power. 
	Thus the superior man makes himself strong and 
	untiring.`,image:`Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which 
heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete 
revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means 
that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is 
the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea 
of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor 
slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This 
duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative. 
  With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so 
that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way, 
by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains 
that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his 
activity.

Hidden dragon. Do not act.`,expl:"In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged, dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative forces on earth begin to stir again.  Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time will fulfill itself.  One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something for which the time is not yet ripe."},{poem:`Nine in the second place means:

Such a man is destined to gain great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it is favorable to see him."},{poem:`Nine in the third place means:

There are all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But danger lurks here at the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and remains blameless."},{poem:`Nine in the fourth place means:

He can go the way of the hero or that of the holy sage who seeks seclusion. There is no general law of his being. If the individual acts consistently and is true to himself, he will find the way that is appropriate for him. This way is right for him and without blame."},{poem:`Nine in the fifth place means:

	If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
	He goes astray;
	But if he follows, he finds guidance.
	It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
	To forego friends in the east and north.
	Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.`,resume:`This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents 
the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the 
hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of 
THE CREATIVE\u2014the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does 
not combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to 
spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal 
as against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the 
principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation 
between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and 
between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears 
in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.

  But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly 
defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course 
the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of 
devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the 
Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it 
is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand 
as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil.  The result 
then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of 
evil to both.
	`,judgment:`The four fundamental aspects of the Creative\u2014"sublime success, furthering 
through perseverance"\u2014are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however, 
the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive 
connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. 
The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a 
specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here 
added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the 
dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a 
symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because 
the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the 
gentleness and devotion of the cow.

  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad 
impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness 
lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to 
give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the 
Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive. 
Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in 
conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an 
independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must 
achieve something. It is not his task to try to lead\u2014that would only make him 
lose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an 
attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man 
lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the 
situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from 
fate.

  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in 
the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The 
time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south 
symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature 
does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all 
one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find 
friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and 
effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The 
east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and 
the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he 
must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without 
companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional 
hates and favoritism.
	`,image:{oracle:`	The earth's condition is receptive devotion.
	Thus the superior man who has breadth of character
	Carries the outer world.`,image:`Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the 
hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time, 
but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension 
in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things 
that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good 
and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his 
character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to 
support and to bear with people and things.

On the other hand, movement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any effort' yet everything turns out as it should.  Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions.

which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram Ch\xEAn is the Arousing; its 
motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands 
for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is 
rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill 
the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward

We must wait until the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend intended for us.  Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of grave conflicts, the hexagram gives counsel for a special situation. When in times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of decision is impaired.

The image of the upper trigram, K\xEAn, is the mountain, that of the lower, 
K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of 
inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram; that of 
the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a 
dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth. However, the two trigrams 
also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something 
that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at 
first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its 
progress, and success is attained.
	`,judgment:`In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it, 
provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward 
him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his 
lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and 
this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which 
should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason 
why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only 
thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.

  A teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite 
like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key 
for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or 
unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He 
does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and 
refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt.

  Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are 
mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram 
counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.

with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it 
come; we have to wait for it. The idea of waiting is further suggested by the 
attributes of the two trigrams\u2014strength within, danger in from. Strength in 
the face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weakness 
in the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.
	`,judgment:`Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the 
goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads 
to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the 
great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness 
and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, 
for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows 
itself in uncompromising truthfulness (with himself). It is only when we 
have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-
deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the 
path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by 
resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate 
resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross 
the great water\u2014that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary 
decision and of surmounting the danger.

  Of the individual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong 
nine in the second place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are 
subordinate. This line indicates a commander, because it stands in the 
middle of one of the two trigrams. But since it is in the lower rather than the 
upper trigram, it represents not the ruler but the efficient general, who 
maintains obedience in the army by his authority.

Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline 
must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the 
hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may 
develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must 
entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always 
a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore 
it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used 
as a last recourse.

to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a 
people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people 
economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must 
therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people

One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may have been misread as shih, which means "corpse."

example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together. Symbolically this 
connotes holding together and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is 
suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the 
place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they 
are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is 
their center of union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn 
holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his own 
nature.
	`,judgment:`What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may 
complement and aid one another through holding together. But such 
holding together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may 
unite. To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave 
matter and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit, 
consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others 
about him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone 
attempting the task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse 
than if no union at all had taken place.

  But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or 
uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late-comers must suffer the 
consequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is also 
important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according to 
definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who 
comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a 
straggler, he finds the door locked.

  If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong 
enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some 
other organic fellowship.

together through a community of interests that allows each individual to feel

	The superior man carries things through.`,resume:`This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K\xEAn, Keeping Still, mountain, and 
K'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative 
of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain 
that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with 
heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great 
and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the 
earth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, by 
being placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in 
lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.
	`,judgment:`It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is 
modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven, 
turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In 
obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and 
when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out in the 
fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and to contribute to the 
modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys are 
filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper the 
modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest.

  The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill 
themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his 
behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces. 
When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines 
with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot 
be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end 
without boasting of what he has achieved.

There are officials who indeed do not strive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of ordinances, decline all responsibility, accept pay without giving its equivalent in work, and bear empty titles.

devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying all with it. Of great 
importance, furthermore, is the law of movement along the line of least

	`,judgment:`The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand an 
eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts in

enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances to 
the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural laws 
rests on this principle of movement along the line of least resistance. Theses 
laws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of 
movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not 
deviate from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed 
regularity. It is the same with human society: only such laws are rooted in 
popular sentiment can be enforced, while laws violating this sentiment 
merely arouse resentment.

  Again, it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for the completion 
of an undertaking without fear of secret opposition. It is enthusiasm too that 
can unify mass movements, as in war, so that they achieve victory.

rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes 
nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make 
themselves felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and 
to loosen the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart 
expresses itself involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic 
movement of the body. From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the 
invisible sound that moves all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified 
mankind.

  Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated and 
regulated it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed 
to purify the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes 
and thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the temple men 
drew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later the theater 
developed). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was united with 
the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors. The 
ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests of the Ruler of 
Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions. This 
uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of 
religious inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler 
who revered the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of 
Heaven, in whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical 
contact.

Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the 
possibilities of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-
symbolized by crossing of the great water-but must take hold energetically. 
Success depends, however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the 
lines, "Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three 
days." We must first know the cause of corruption before we can do away 
with them; hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the 
start. Then we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that 
a relapse may be avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time after 
the start. Decisiveness and energy must take the place of inertia and 
indifference that have led to decay, in order that the ending may be followed 
by a new beginning.

	But not yet the offering.
	Full of trust they look up to him.`,resume:`A slight variation of tonal stress gives the Chinese name for this hexagram a 
double meaning.  It means both contemplating and being seen, in the sense 
of being an example. These ideas are suggested by the fact that the hexagram 
can be understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China.

A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the same 
time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen 
for miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the 
law of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by 
means of good government, sets a lofty example to the masses.

  This hexagram is linked with the eight month (September-October). The 
light-giving power retreats and the dark power is again on the increase. 
However, this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram as a 
whole.
	`,judgment:`The sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a libation by which 
the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice was offered. The moment of 
time between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment of 
deepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith, the 
contemplation of it has a transforming awe-spiring effect on those who 
witness it.

  Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that natural 
occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the divine 
meaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who is 
called upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. This 
requires that power of inner concentration which religious contemplation 
develops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to apprehend the 
mysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest inner 
concentration they give expression to these laws in their own persons. Thus 
a hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating 
others without their being aware of how it happens. 

	`,image:{oracle:`	The wind blows over the earth:
	The image of CONTEMPLATION.
	Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,
	Contemplated the people,
	And gave them instruction.`,image:`When the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and the grass must 
bend to its power. These two occurrences find confirmation in the hexagram. 
The two images are used to symbolize a practice of the kings of old; in making 
regular journeys the ruler could, in the first place, survey his realm and make 
certain that none of the existing usages of the people escaped notice; in the 
second, he could exert influence through which such customs as were 
unsuitable could be changed.

  All of this points to the power possessed by a superior personality. On the 
one hand, such a man will have a view of the real sentiments of the great 
mass of humanity and therefore cannot be deceived; on the other, he will 
impress the people so profoundly, by his mere existence and by the impact of 
his personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the wind.

It is not necessary for her to be conversant with the affairs of the world. But for a man who must take active part in public life, such a narrow, egotistic way of contemplating things is of course harmful."},{poem:`Six in the third place means:

	It is favorable to let justice be administered.`,resume:`This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram 27) with an 
obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot 
meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the 
obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for 
lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature.  
Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the 
lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing 
tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances 
of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of 
this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung, 
CONFLICT (6), which refers to civil suits.
	`,judgment:`When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success. 
This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the 
obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking 
the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at 
once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord. 
Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.

  However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram 
combines Li, clarity, and Ch\xEAn, excitement. Li is yielding, Ch\xEAn is hard. 
Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out 
punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two 
together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes 
the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he 
commands respect by his conduct in his position.

Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws
specify the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe
penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes.
This is symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened
by a just application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror
of thunder. This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling
respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.
The obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a
lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them.
The only to strengthen the law is to make it clear and make penalties
certain and swift.

been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by 
force. The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus the 
movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the 
transformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is 
introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. 
Societies of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these 
groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the 
time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. 
The idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature. The movement is 
cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten 
anything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is 
the meaning of heaven and earth. 
  All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings 
return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins, 
comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes 
in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is the number of 
the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is 
increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives place to movement.

	The image of THE TURNING POINT.

the year\u2014a custom that survives in the time of rest observed at the new year. 
In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the Arousing, is still 
underground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore it must be 
strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being used 
prematurely. This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itself to 
be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations. The return of health 
after illness, the return of understanding after an estrangement: everything 
must be treated tenderly and with care at the beginning, so that the return 
may lead to a flowering.

Ch\xEAn is under the influence of the strong line it has received form above,

heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural and true, 
unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious 
purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost. 
Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature.

unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and

instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through 
perseverance". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher 
sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of 
heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of 
acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs

	Not eating at home brings good fortune.

situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u, THE 
TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the 
Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four 
strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there 
is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger.

  The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the 
concept "Holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of 
holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram K\xEAn which holds 
the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding 
back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and 
nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, 
which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third 
of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, 
which represents the sage.
	`,judgment:`To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this 
hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the 
ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; K\xEAn indicates 
firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of 
character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the 
height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in 
periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the 
power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the 
case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an 
advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon 
public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great 
and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.

	Pay heed to the providing of nourishment

of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth, through 
which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment 
itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented in the 
three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment and 
care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.
	`,judgment:`In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right people 
should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment 
in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to 
observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he 
cultivates and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man 
fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men 
through them. Mencius says about this:

If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observe 
what part of his being he regards as especially important. The body has 
superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must not injure 
important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure the 
superior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates the inferior parts 
of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the superior parts of his 
nature is a superior man.

forces stir again, all things comes into being anew. "He brings to perfection in 
the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when the seeds fall to 
earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing nourishment 
through movement and tranquillity.  The superior man takes it as a pattern 
for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement 
going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from 
without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity. 
For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding 
proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding 
its proper measure. Thus character is cultivated.

in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a 
revolution is not to be feared. Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures. 
The problem must be solved by gently penetration to the meaning of the

	If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,
	And whatever you do succeeds.`,resume:`This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It is one of the 
eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means a 
plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed 
in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the middle son. 
The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K'an 
develops. As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above 
and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on 
earth.

  In man's world K'an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the 
body, the principle of light inclosed in the dark\u2014that is, reason. The name of 
the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning, 
"repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an 
objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective 
attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness 
or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger; it is a situation in 
which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water, 
he can escape if he behaves correctly.
	`,judgment:`Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the 
example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and on, 
and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not shrink 
from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose 
its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus 
likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can 
penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner 
mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will 
succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done-
-thoroughness\u2014and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in 
the danger.

  Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective 
measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every 
attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water, 
separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger to 
protect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.

form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. As water pours down 
from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While K'an means the soul 
shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.
	`,judgment:`What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of the 
latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself something 
that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything that gives 
light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may 
continue to shine.

  Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to 
the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is 
right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is conditioned 
and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself 
dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he 
achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating in

clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.

sense "to influence," "to stimulate." The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous; the 
lower is K\xEAn, Keeping still. By its persistent, quiet influence, the lower, rigid 
trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds to this 
stimulation cheerfully and joyously. K\xEAn, the lower trigram, is the youngest 
son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter. Thus the universal mutual 
attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship, the masculine 
principle must seize the initiative and place itself below the feminine 
principle.

  Just as the first part of book 1 begins with the hexagrams of heaven and 
earth, the foundations of all that exists, the second part begins with the 
hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations of all social 
relationships.
	`,judgment:`The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their powers attract each 
other, so that they unite. This brings about success, for all success depends on 
the effect of mutual attraction. By keeping still within while experiencing joy 
without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess and hold it within 
proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition, "Perseverance 
furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference between seduction 
and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a position inferior to that of 
the weak girl and shows consideration for her. This attraction between 
affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven and earth attract each other and 
thus all creatures come into being. Through such attraction the sage 
influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains peace. From the 
attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings in heaven and on 
earth.

What the heart desires, the thighs run after without a moment's hesitation; they hold to the heart, which they follow. In the life of man, however, acting on the spur of every caprice is wrong and if continued leads to humiliation. Three considerations suggest themselves here. First, a man should not run precipitately after all the persons whom he would like to influence, but must be able to hold back under certain circumstances. As little should he yield immediately to every whim of those in whose service he stands. Finally, where the moods of his own heart are concerned, he should never ignore the possibility of inhibition, for this is the basis of human freedom."},{poem:`Nine in the fourth place means:

It is of particular concern that this influence be constant and good; then, in spite of the danger arising from the great susceptibility of the human heart, there will be no cause for remorse. When the quiet power of a man's own character is at work, the effects produced are right. All those who are receptive to the vibrations of such a spirit will then be influenced. Influence over others should not express itself as a conscious and willed effort to manipulate them. Through practicing such conscious incitement, one becomes wrought up and is exhausted by the eternal stress and strain.

trigram indicates gentleness within; the upper, movement without.

  In the sphere of social relationships, the hexagram represents the institution 
of marriage as the enduring union of the sexes. During courtship the young 
man subordinates himself to the girl, but in marriage, which is represented by 
the coming together of the eldest son and the eldest daughter, the husband is 
the directing and moving force outside, while the wife, inside, is gentle and 
submissive.
	`,judgment:`Duration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances. It is 
not a state of rest, for mere standstill is regression. Duration is rather the self-
contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly 
integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and 
beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward 
movement, by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns into 
a new beginning, in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation, 
diastole, expansion.

  Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and 
because of this their light-giving power endures. The seasons of the year 
follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce effects 
that endure.

  So likewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way 
of life, and thereby the world is formed. In that which gives things their 
duration, we can come to understand the nature of all beings in heaven and 
on earth.

their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure. In the same 
way the independence of the superior man is not based on rigidity and 
immobility of character. He always keeps abreast of the time and changes

being, which determines all his actions.

natural law. Therefore in this case withdrawal is proper; it is the correct way 
to behave in order not to exhaust one's forces.

  In the calendar this hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July-August), 
in which the forces of winter are already showing their influence.
	`,judgment:`Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are advancing. 
In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to be confused with flight. 
Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances, whereas retreat is a 
sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss the right moment while we 
are in full possession of power and position. Then we shall be able to 
interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and to prepare for 
provisional retreat instead of being drawn into a desperate life-and-death 
struggle. Thus we do not simple abandon the field to the opponent; we make 
it difficult for him to advance by showing perseverance in single acts of 
resistance. In this way we prepare, while retreating, for the counter-
movement. Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is 
not easy. The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.

to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into the 
distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of the 
superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts as 
the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is a form 
of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object. The 
superior man shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior man to a

not degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the 
fundamental principles of right and of justice. When we understand this

It will be thought that he belong to the party of the inferior man. He will be lonely because no one will understand him.

male. It is an unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must understand 
and promptly prevent the possible consequences.

  The hexagram is linked with the fifth month (June-July), because at the 
summer solstice the principle of darkness gradually becomes ascendant again. 

	`,judgment:`The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the image of a bold girl 
who lightly surrenders herself and thus seizes power. This would not be 
possible if the strong and light-giving element had not in turn come halfway. 
The inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man delights in it; it 
looks so small and weak that he imagines he may dally with it and come to 
no harm.

  The inferior man rises only because the superior man does not regard him 
as dangerous and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the fist, he 
could never gain influence.

  The time of COMING TO MEET is important in still another way. 
Although as a general rule the weak should not come to meet the strong, 
there are times when this has great significance. When heaven and earth 
come to meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and his official 
come to meet each other, the world is put in order. It is necessary for 
elements predestined to be joined and mutually dependent to come to meet 
one another halfway. But the coming together must be free of dishonest 
ulterior motives, otherwise harm will result.

In the latter, water is over the earth; here a lake is over the earth. But 
since the lake is a place where water collects, the idea of gathering together is 
even more strongly expressed here than in the other hexagram. The same 
idea also arises from the fact that in the present case it is two strong lines (the 
fourth and the fifth) that bring about the gather together, whereas in the 
former case one strong line (the fifth) stands in the midst of weak lines.
	`,judgment:`The gathering together of people in large communities is either a natural 
occurrence, as in the case of the family, or an artificial one, as in the case of 
the state. The family gathers about the father as its head. The perpetuation of 
this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice to the ancestors, at 
which the whole clan is gathered together. Through the collective piety of 
the living members of the family, the ancestors become so integrated in the 
spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed or dissolved.

  Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed. But 
there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group. In 
order to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all be 
collected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite the world. 
Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them. 
This is the significance of the great offerings that are made. In the secular 
sphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time of GATHERING

water. The image derives from the pole-and-bucket well of ancient China. 
The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made of 
clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from the 
well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift water out of the 
earth by means of their fibers.

  The well from which water is drawn conveys the further idea of an 
inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.
	`,judgment:`In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake 
of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. The style 
of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the well 
has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well is the 
symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its 
most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political 
structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains 
eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. It grows 
neither less not more; it exists for one and for all. The generations come and 
go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance.

  However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social 
organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. 
For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs 
unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. 
Carelessness-by which the jug is broken-is also disastrous. If for instance the 
military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by 
which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug.

  This hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in 
disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same 
in everyone. And every human being can draw in the course of his 
education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man's nature. 
But here likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to 
penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention-a 
partial education of this sort is as bad as none- or he may suddenly collapse 
and neglect his self-development.

  The two trigrams making up the hexagram are the same two that appear in 
K'uei, OPPOSITION (38), that is, the two younger daughters, Li and Tui. But 
while there the elder of the two daughters is above, and what results is 
essentially only an opposition of tendencies, here the younger daughter is 
above. The influences are in actual conflict, and the forces combat each other 
like fire and water (lake), each trying to destroy the other. Hence the idea of 
revolution.
	`,judgment:`Political revolutions are extremely grave matters. They should be undertaken 
only under stress of direst necessity, when there is no other way out. Not 
everyone is called to this task, but only the man who has the confidence of 
the people, and even he only when the time is ripe. He must then proceed in 
the right way, so that he gladdens the people and, by enlightening them, 
prevents excesses. Furthermore, he must be quite free of selfish aims and 
must really relieve the need of the people. Only then does he have nothing to 
regret.

  Times change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons change in

	Success.`,resume:`The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at the bottom are 
the legs, over them the belly, then come the ears (handles), and at the top the 
carrying rings. At the same time, the image suggests the idea of nourishment. 
The ting, cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cooked viands in the 
temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The heads of the family served the 
food from the ting into the bowls of the guests.

  THE WELL (48) likewise has the secondary meaning of giving nourishment, 
but rather more in relation to the people. The ting, as a utensil pertaining to 
a refined civilization, suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men, 
which redounded to the benefit of the state.

  This hexagram and THE WELL are the only two in the Book of Changes that 
represent concrete, men-made objects. Yet here too the thought has its 
abstract connotation.

  Sun, below, is wood and wind; Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand 
for the flame kindled by wood and wind, which likewise suggests the idea of 
preparing food.
	`,judgment:`While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life, and this 
foundation is likened to the water that serves to nourish growing wood, the 
present hexagram refers to the cultural superstructure of society. Here it is 
the wood that serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that is 
visible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of the invisible. 
Thereby it receives its true consecration and clarity and takes firm root in the 
cosmic order.

  Here we see civilization as it reaches its culmination in religion. The ting 
serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest earthly values must be 
sacrificed to the divine. But the truly divine does not manifest itself apart 
from man. The supreme revelation of God appears in prophets and holy 
men. To venerate them is true veneration of God. The will of God, as 
revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this brings inner 
enlightenment and true understanding of the world, and this leads to great 
good fortune and success.

burns above. It is the same in human life; there is in man likewise a fate that 
lends power to his life. And if he succeeds in assigning the right place to life 
and to fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on a firm 
footing. These words contain hints about fostering of life as handed on by 
oral tradition in the secret teachings of Chinese yoga.

These two metaphors express the idea that in a highly developed civilization, such as that indicated by this hexagram, every person of good will can in some way or other succeed. No matter how lowly he may be, provided he is ready to purify himself, he is accepted.

If the handle is altered, the ting cannot be lifted up and used, and, sad to say, the delicious food in it, such as pheasant fat, cannot be eaten by anyone.  This describes a man who, in a highly evolved civilization, finds himself in a place where no one notices or recognizes him. This is a severe block to his effectiveness. All of his good qualities and gifts of mind thus needlessly go to waste.

earth. The male principle is at the top because it strives upward by nature; the 
female principle is below, since the direction of its movement has come to its 
normal end.

  In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problem of 
achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart. While 
Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement in 
nirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polarity that 
always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words of the text 
embody directions for the practice of yoga.
	`,judgment:`True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still, and 
going forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest and 
movement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there is 
light in life.

  The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of all movement. The 
back is named because in the back are located all the nerve fibers that mediate 
movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves is brought to a standstill, 
the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as it were. When a man has thus 
become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He no longer sees in it the 
struggle and tumult of individual beings, and therefore he has that true peace 
of mind which is needed for understanding the great laws of the universe 
and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever acts from these deep levels

develops slowly according to the law of its being and consequently stands 
firmly rooted. This gives the idea of a development that proceeds gradually, 
step by step. The attributes of the trigrams also point to this: within is 
tranquillity, which guards against precipitate actions, and without is 
penetration, which makes development and progress possible.
	`,judgment:`The development of events that leads to a girl's following a man to his home 
proceeds slowly. The various formalities must be disposed of before the 
marriage takes place. This principle of gradual development can be applied to 
other situations as well; it is always applicable where it is a matter of correct 
relationships of co-operation, as for instance in the appointment of an official. 
The development must be allowed to take its proper course. Hasty action 
would not be wise. This is also true, finally, of any effort to exert influence on 
others, for here too the essential factor is a correct way of development 
through cultivation of one's own personality. No influence such as that 
exerted by agitators has a lasting effect.

  Within the personality too, development must follow the same course if 
lasting results are to be achieved. Gentleness that is adaptable, but at the same 
time penetrating, is the outer form that should proceed from inner calm.

  The very gradualness of the development makes it necessary to have 
perseverance, for perseverance alone prevents slow progress from dwindling 
to nothing.

is of lasting effect. Progress must be quite gradual, and in order to obtain such 
progress in public opinion and in the mores of the people, it is necessary for 
the personality to acquire influence and weight. This comes about through 
careful and constant work on one's own moral development.

the dispersing and dissolving of divisive egotism. DISPERSION shows the 
way, so to speak, that leads to gathering together. This explains the similarity 
of the two texts.

  Religious forces are needed to overcome the egotism that divides men. The 
common celebration of the great sacrificial feasts and sacred rites, which gave 
expression simultaneously to the interrelation and social articulation of the 
family and state, was the means of employed by the great ruler to unite men. 
The sacred music and the splendor of the ceremonies aroused a strong tide of 
emotion that was shared by all hearts in unison, and that awakened a 
consciousness of the common origin of all creatures. In this way disunity was 
overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further means to the same end is co-
operation in great general undertakings that set a high goal for the will of the 
people; in the common concentration on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just 
as, when a boat is crossing a great stream, all hands must unite in a joint task.

  But only a man who is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations, and 
who perseveres in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving the 
hardness of egotism.

rigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and cupidity isolate men. 
Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout emotion. They must 
be shaken by a religious awe in face of eternity-stirred with an intuition of the 
One Creator of all living beings, and united through the strong feeling of 
fellowship experienced in the ritual of divine worship.

overflows. Therefore limits must be set for the water. The image shows 
water below and water above, with the firmament between them as a limit.

  The Chinese word for limitation really denotes the joints that divide a 
bamboo stalk. In relation to ordinary life it means the thrift that sets fixed 
limits upon expenditures. In relation to the moral sphere it means the fixed 
limits that the superior man sets upon his actions-the limits of loyalty and 
disinterestedness.
	`,judgment:`Limitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we live economically 
in normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be sparing saves us 
from humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in the regulation of 
world conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter, 
day and night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In the same way, 
economy, by setting fixed limits upon expenditures, acts to preserve property 
and prevent injury to the people.

  But in limitation we must observe due measure. If a man should seek to 
impose galling limitations upon his own nature, it would be injurious. And 
if he should go too far in imposing limitations on others, they would rebel. 
Therefore it is necessary to set limits even upon limitation.

a definite amount of the infinite quantity of water; this is its peculiarity. In 
human life too the individual achieves significance through discrimination 
and the setting of limits. Therefore what concerns us here is the problem of 
clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so to speak, the backbone of 
morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited to man; if they existed, his life 
would only dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man's life needs 
the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily accepted. The individual 
attains significance as a free spirit only by surrounding himself with these 
limitations and by determining for himself what his duty is.

effects of the invisible manifest themselves. The hexagram consists of firm 
lines above and below, while it is open in the center. This indicates a heart 
free of prejudices and therefore open to truth. On the other hand, each of the 
two trigrams has a firm line in the middle; this indicates the force of inner 
truth in the influences they present.

  The attributes of the two trigrams are: above, gentleness, forbearance 
toward inferiors; below, joyousness in obeying superiors. Such conditions 
create the basis of a mutual confidence that makes achievements possible.

  The character of fu ("truth") is actually the picture of a bird's foot over a 
fledgling. It suggests the idea of brooding. An egg is hollow. The light-giving 
power must work to quicken it from outside, but there must be a germ of life 
within, if life is to be awakened. Far-reaching speculations can be linked with 
these ideas.
	`,judgment:`Pigs and fishes are the least intelligent of all animals and therefore the most 
difficult to influence. The force of inner truth must grow great indeed before 
its influence can extend to such creatures. In dealing with persons as 
intractable and as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole secret of 
success depends on finding the right way of approach. One must first rid 
oneself of all prejudice and, so to speak, let the psyche of the other person act 
on one without restraint. Then one will establish contact with him, 
understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus been opened, 
the force of one's personality will influence him. If in this way one finds no 
obstacles insurmountable, one can undertake even the most dangerous 
things, such as crossing the great water, and succeed.

  But it is important to understand upon what the force inner truth depends. 
This force is not identical with simple intimacy or a secret bond. Close ties 
may exist also among thieves; it is true that such a bond acts as a force but, 
since it is not invincible, it does not bring good fortune. All association on 
the basis of common interests holds only up to a certain point. Where the 
community of interest ceases, the holding together ceases also, and the closest 
friendship often changes into hate. Only when the bond is based on what is 
right, on steadfastness, will it remain so firm that it triumphs over 
everything.

China, the entire administration of justice was guided by this principle. A 
deep understanding that knows how to pardon was considered the highest 
form of justice. This system was not without success, for its aim was to make 
so strong a moral impression that there was no reason to fear abuse of such 
mildness. For it sprang not from weakness but from a superior clarity.

It may be quite hidden when it sounds its call; yet its young will hear its not, will recognize it and give answer. Where there is a joyous mood, there a comrade will appear to share a glass of wine.  This is the echo awakened in men through spiritual attraction. Whenever a feeling is voiced with truth and frankness, whenever a deed is the clear expression of sentiment, a mysterious and far-reaching influence is exerted. At first it acts on those who are inwardly receptive. But the circle grows larger and larger. The root of all influence lies in one's own inner being: given true and vigorous expression in word and deed, its effect is great. The effect is but the reflection of something that emanates from one's own heart. Any deliberate intention of an effect would only destroy the possibility of producing it. Confucius says about this line:The superior man abides in his room. If his words are well spoken, he meets with assent at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! If the superior man abides in his room and his words are not well spoken, he meets with contradiction at a distance of more than a thousand miles. How much more then from near by! Words go forth from one's own person and exert their influence on men. Deeds are born close at hand and become visible far away. Words and deeds are the hinge and bowspring of the superior man.

Only be pursuing one's course like a horse that goes straight ahead without looking sidewise at its mate, can one retain the inner freedom that helps one onward."},{poem:`Nine in the fifth place means:

	Perseverance furthers.
	Small things may be done; great things should not be done.
	The flying bird brings the message:
	It is not well to strive upward,
	It is well to remain below.
	Great good fortune.`,resume:`While in the hexagram Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT (28), the 
strong lines preponderate and are within, inclosed between weak lines at the 
top and bottom, the present hexagram has weak lines preponderating, though 
here again they are on the outside, the strong lines being within. This indeed 
is the basis of the exceptional situation indicated by the hexagram. When 
strong lines are outside, we have the hexagram I, PROVIDING 
NOURISHMENT (27), or Chung Fu, INNER TRUTH, (61); neither represents 
and exceptional state. When strong elements within preponderate, they 
necessarily enforce their will. This creates struggle and exceptional conditions 
in general. But in the present hexagram it is the weak element that perforce 
must mediate with the outside world. If a man occupies a position of 
authority for which he is by nature really inadequate, extraordinary prudence 
is necessary.
	`,judgment:`Exceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be rewarded with 
success; however, if a man is not to throw himself away, it is important that 
they should not become empty form and subservience but be combined 
always with a correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the 
demands of the time in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies 
and damages. In any event we must not count on great success, since the 
requisite strength is lacking. In this lies the importance of the message that 
one should not strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things.

  The structure of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is 
brought by a bird. In Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT (28), the 
four strong, heavy lines within, supported only by two weak lines without, 
give the image of a sagging ridgepole. Here the supporting weak lines are 
both outside and preponderant; this gives the image of a soaring bird. But a 
bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the sun; it should descend to 
the earth, where its nest is. In this way it gives the message conveyed by the 
hexagram.
	`,image:{oracle:`	Thunder on the mountain:
	The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL.
	Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.
	In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.
	In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.`,image:`Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain. In the 
mountains, thunder seems much nearer; outside the mountains, it is less 
audible than the thunder of an ordinary storm. Thus the superior man 
derives an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes more 
closely and more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though 
this might make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is 
exceptionally conscientious in his actions. In bereavement emotion means 
more to him than ceremoniousness. In all his personal expenditures he is 
extremely simple and unpretentious. In comparison with the man of the 
masses, all this makes him stand out as exceptional. But the essential 
significance of his attitude lies in the fact that in external matters he is on the 
side of the lowly.

Hence his closest relations are with the grandfather. The present line designates the grandson's wife, who during the sacrifice passes by the ancestor and goes toward the ancestress. This unusual behavior is, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures rather to approach the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their common sex. Hence here deviation from the rule is not a mistake.  Another image is that of the official who, in compliance with regulation, first seeks an audience with his prince. If he is not successful in this, he does not try to force anything but goes about conscientious fulfillment of his duty, taking his place among the other officials. This extraordinary restraint is likewise not a mistake in exceptional times. (The rule is that every official should first have an audience with the prince by whom he is appointed. Here the appointment is made by the minister.)"},{poem:`Nine in the third place means:

But it is just in such life situations that we find upright and strong personalities who, conscious of being in the right, disdain to hold themselves on guard, because they consider it petty. Instead, they go their way proud and unconcerned. But this self-confidence deludes them. There are dangers lurking for which they are unprepared. Yet such danger is not unavoidable; one can escape it if he understands that the time demands that he pay especial attention to small and insignificant thing."},{poem:`Nine in the fourth place means:

Similarly, in exceptional times there may be a born ruler who is qualified to set the world in order, but who cannot achieve anything or confer blessing on the people because he stands alone and has no helpers. Is such times a man must seek out helpers with whose aid he can carry out the task. But these helpers must be modestly sought out in the retirement to which they have withdrawn. It is not in the fame nor their great names but their genuine achievements that are important. Through such modesty the right man is found, and the exceptional task is carried out in spite of all difficulties."}]}},{number:63,name:"Chi Chi",description:"After Completion",trigrams:{above:{title:"kan",description:"THE ABYSMAL, WATER"},below:{title:"li",description:"THE  CLINGING, FIRE"}},interpretation:{oracle:`Success in small matters.

confusion to order is completed, and everything is in its proper place even in 
particulars. The strong lines are in the strong places, the weak lines in the 
weak places. This is a very favorable outlook, yet it gives reason for thought. 
For it is just when perfect equilibrium has been reached that any movement 
may cause order to revert to disorder. The one strong line that has moved to 
the top, thus effecting complete order in details, is followed by the other lines. 
Each moving according to its nature, and thus suddenly there arises again the 
hexagram P'i, STANDSTILL (12).

  Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax, 
which necessitate the utmost caution.
	`,judgment:`The transition from the old to the new time is already accomplished. In 
principle, everything stands systematized, and it si only in regard to details 
that success is still to be achieved. In respect to this, however, we must be 
careful to maintain the right attitude. Everything proceeds as if of its own 
accord, and this can all too easily tempt us to relax and let thing take their 
course without troubling over details. Such indifference is the root of all evil. 
Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result. Here we have the rule 
indicating the usual course of history. But this rule is not an inescapable law. 
He who understands it is in position to avoid its effects by dint of unremitting 
perseverance and caution.

and thus generate energy (cf. the production of steam). But the resulting 
tension demands caution. If the water boils over, the fire is extinguished an 
its energy is lost. If the heat is too great, the water evaporates into the air. 
These elements here brought in to relation and thus generating energy are by 
nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution can prevent 
damage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are in balance and 
work in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best of order. In such

It was regarded as a breach of propriety to drive on if this curtain was lost.  Applied to public life, this means that a man who wants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the authorities which he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection. Especially in times "after completion" it may happen that those who have come to power grow arrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves about fostering new talent.  This as a rule results in office seeking. If a man's superiors withhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it and of drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthy procedure: "Do not seek it." Do not throw yourself away on the world, but wait tranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change. When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That which is a man's own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord.

After putting his realm in order with a strong hand, he waged long colonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied the northern borderland with constant threat of incursions.  The situation described is as follows. After times of completion, when a new power has arisen and everything within the country has been set in order, a period of colonial expansion almost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out struggles must be reckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy is especially important. The territory won at such bitter cost must not be regarded as an almshouse for people who in one way or another have hade themselves impossible at home, but who are thought to be quite good enough for the colonies. Such a policy ruins at the outset any chance of success. This holds true in small as well as large matters, because it is not only rising states that carry on a colonial policy; the urge to expand, with its accompanying dangers, is part and parcel of every ambitious undertaking.'},{poem:`Six in the fourth place means:

fruitful time of summer. With this hopeful outlook the Book of Changes 
come to its close.

nothing less than that of leading the world out of confusion back to order. 
But it is a task that promises success, because there is a goal that can unite the 
forces now tending in different directions. At first, however, one must move 
warily, like an old fox walking over ice. The caution of a fox walking over ice 
is proverbial in China. His ears are constantly alert to the cracking of the ice, 
as he carefully and circumspectly searches out the safest spots. A young fox 
who as yet has not acquired this caution goes ahead boldly, and it may happen 
that he falls in and gets his tail wet when he is almost across the water. Then 
of course his effort has been all in vain. Accordingly, in times "before 
completion," deliberation and caution are the prerequisites of success.

bring these forces to bear in the right place, they will have the desired effect
